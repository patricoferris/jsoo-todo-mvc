*Status: WIP, incomplete and hacky*

## Overview

This repository contains a few experiments in building [todo-mvc][] apps written in OCaml using [js_of_ocaml][]. There are quite a few projects I hope to build in the near future with a lot of data and UI components and of course, I want to build them in OCaml. Before choosing a library for doing that I wanted to experiment with them in a simple application. I'm not particularly interested in performance or size of output at this stage but more in the pleasure of working with them. If I have used the libraries in a non-idiomatic fashion... let me know/please open an issue or PR.

*Note, the TODO apps do NOT try to implement all of the features of TodoMVC. In fact, they are quite broken and incomplete at the time of writing. If I find more time I'll finish them up.*

So far there is a [bonsai][] implementation and a [brr-lwd][] implementation.
